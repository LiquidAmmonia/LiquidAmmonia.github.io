I am a research engineer at [Zhipu.AI](https://www.zhipuai.cn), focusing on improving the performance of VLM's on video, alignment, reasoning, etc. My research interets lies visual understanding and generation, language modeling and world modeling.

I received my Master's degree from the School of Computer Science at Peking University, at [CILab](https://ci.idm.pku.edu.cn/) & [AIIC](http://aiic.pku.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. Boxin Shi and Mr. Ming Lei. I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Automation and Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics from Tsinghua University in 2021. My academic research topic involves 3D modeling with neural implicit representations, computational photography, and image quality enhancement.

Deep learning is a useful tool (arguably more useful than most people think) for real-world applications. I enjoy tackling various tasks (e.g., molecule design, quantitative trading, interior design, recommendation system, image quality enhancement) with AI techniques and seeing the real-world impact of my work. I have worked (mostly interned) at wonderful AI start-ups ([Collov](https://collov.ai/), [QuanMol](https://quanmol.com/)), corporate companies (Alibaba, ByteDance), and a quantitative investment firm ([Definitive Capital Managment](https://zding.fund/)). Along the way, I have met many mentors and peers in the field of intelligence. Please feel free to contact me if interested.
