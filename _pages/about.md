Emai1: cya17 [at] stu [dot] pku [dot] edu [dot] cn

I am a currently Master student at [CILab](https://ci.idm.pku.edu.cn/) & [AIIC](http://aiic.pku.edu.cn/) in the school of Computer Science in Peking University, advised by Prof. Boxin Shi. I received my B.E. degree in Automation from Tsinghua University in 2021. My research interests include computer vision, deep learning, and their applications in Implicit Radiance Fields and Generative models.
