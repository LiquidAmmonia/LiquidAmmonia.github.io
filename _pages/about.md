I am a currently Master student at [CILab](https://ci.idm.pku.edu.cn/) & [AIIC](http://aiic.pku.edu.cn/) in the school of Computer Science in Peking University, advised by Prof. Boxin Shi. I received my B.E. degree in Automation and B.A in Economics (double major) from Tsinghua University in 2021.

My research interests include deep learning and computer vision. I have worked on image super-resolution, lighting estimation, implicit neural representations and diffusion models. Feel free to contact me with new ideas.
